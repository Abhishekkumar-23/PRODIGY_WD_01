# Prodigy Infotech Web Development Task 1: Interactive Navigation Menu

This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive navigation menu that changes its style based on user interaction (scrolling or hovering over menu items) and maintains a fixed position at the top of the page for better accessibility.

**Features:**

* **Fixed Position:** The menu remains visible at the top of the page, regardless of scrolling.
* **Hover Effect:** When you hover over a menu item, its background or font color changes for a visually appealing interaction.
* **Scroll Effect:** The menu's background or font color adjusts as you scroll down the page, potentially providing a more immersive experience.

**Technologies Used:**

* **HTML:** Structures the navigation menu elements.
* **CSS:** Defines the visual styles of the menu, including layout, colors, and fonts.
* **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity by detecting scroll events and hover interactions, then applying the desired style changes.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites:**

* A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

**Running the Project Locally:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Interact with the navigation menu by scrolling and hovering over menu items to observe the style changes.

**Note:**

This `README.md` file serves as a starting point. You can further customize the project by adding:

* Links to different website sections for each menu item.
* Additional styles to enhance the menu's appearance.
* More advanced JavaScript interactions (e.g., dropdowns, animations).

Feel free to explore and experiment to create a navigation menu that suits your specific website requirements.
